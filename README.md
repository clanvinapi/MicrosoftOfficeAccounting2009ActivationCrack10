## Step 1: Find your product key
     
Your product key is a 25-character code that came with your purchase of Microsoft Office Accounting 2009. It may be printed on a sticker on the CD case, or in an email confirmation if you bought it online. If you have lost your product key, you can try to retrieve it from the registry by following the instructions [here].
     
## Step 2: Enter your product key
     
During installation, you will be prompted to enter your product key. Or, after installation, to enter the product key, select the Start button, and then select Settings > System > Activation > Update product key > Change product key. Enter your product key and follow the instructions on the screen.
     
## Step 3: Activate online or by phone
     
If you have an internet connection, you can activate your product key online by clicking the Activate button. However, some users have reported that this process fails with error message 53762. This may be because Microsoft has closed the website for activating Microsoft Office Accounting 2009. If this happens, you can try to activate your product key by phone. To do this, select the option to activate by phone and call the toll-free number that appears on the screen. You will be asked to provide your installation ID, which is a series of numbers displayed on the screen. The customer service representative will then give you a confirmation ID, which you need to enter on the screen to complete the activation.
     
## Step 4: Enjoy your program
     
Once you have activated your product key, you can use the full features of Microsoft Office Accounting 2009. You can also download and install the Service Pack 2, which provides some bug fixes and improvements for the program. However, keep in mind that Microsoft no longer supports or updates this program, so you may encounter some compatibility or security issues with newer versions of Windows or other software. You may want to consider switching to a newer and supported accounting program in the future.
